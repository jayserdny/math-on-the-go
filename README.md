## Inspiration
Most of the time you do not really want to leave your conversations to do your homework and you do not want to download an app to check if your math answer if correct. So, I decide to develop a solution for you :) Now you can do your math inside Facebook Messenger.

## What it does
This amazing app helps you to either quick calculate math problems or confirm if your answer is correct. You just need to start a conversation with a messenger bot, and it will help you giving you a list of commands you can use.

## How I built it
I building this application in Javascript using Express.js. To solve Math problems, this application uses mathjs library which makes everything work smooth.

## Challenges I ran into
Trying to differentiate each case where the user wants to do a specific thing. Of course, the limit is the sky, or the galaxy...

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud of developing my first Facebook Messenger bot. I never thought that this application can help a lot of person who are struggling in Math and can simplify the way to check an answer.

## What I learned
I have learned how to configure a Facebook Messenger bot by doing this app and how to use matjs library. I also learned that the limit of programming is yourself. If you think you can't do something, is because you have not tried hard.

##Beta Testers?
If you want to beta test this bot, please send me your Facebook username's id to: jayser.mendez@stu.bcc.cuny.edu
I still need to wait for Facebook to approve this bot to be used by everyone.

Or, login to Facebook with the following credentials:

Email: mathtestapp@outlook.com
Password: Testapp123

Then go to messages and open the only message there :)

## What's next for Math on the fly
I am planning to extend the application by allowing users to upload images of Math problems to solve them without typing them into the chat.
